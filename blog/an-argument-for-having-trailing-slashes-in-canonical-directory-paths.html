An argument for having trailing slashes in canonical directory paths
</title>
<h1
id="an-argument-for-having-trailing-slashes-in-canonical-directory-paths">An
argument for having trailing slashes in canonical directory paths</h1>
<p>I was writing some GNU make today and remembered an age old question:
“Should canonical directory paths contain a trailing slash (as in
<code>dir/</code>) or not (as in <code>dir</code>)?”</p>
<p>I always thought that they shouldn’t (so, <code>dir</code>).</p>
<p>That makes concatenation easy: always do <code>$dir/$suffix</code>.
The benefit is that we statically know that <code>$dir</code> must be a
directory since the path separator is present literally at the
concatenation site.</p>
<p>There are no duplicate slashes ever (hint: this is a lie), since
<code>$dir</code> never contains a trailing slash, so no additional path
cleaning (e.g. duplicate slash removal) needs to be done.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. The root directory will always contain a trailing
slash, because that’s all that is (<code>/</code>). There’s no way to
get rid of it. So the <code>$dir/$suffix</code> will always produce
<code>//$suffix</code> when <code>$dir</code> is the root directory.</p>
<p>Repeated slashes are ugly. To fix the ugliness in data, in the code
either a special check for <code>/</code> should be added or the path
must be cleaned.</p>
<p>Well, we replaced the “ugly data” problem with ugly code.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, perhaps canonical directory names should have a trailing slash in
them, for simplicity of the general case.</p>
<p>Then concatenation becomes just <code>$dir$suffix</code>. There isn’t
an literal path separator now at the concatenation site now, but an
argument can be made that such information is not even that useful.
<code>$dir</code> can just be a prefix like
<code>not-actually-in-a-new-directory-</code>, which will be added as a
prefix to <code>$suffix</code>. I can imagine where this behavior can be
useful.</p>
<p>Did I miss anything?</p>
